    <h1>About Brittany </h1>
    <h2>Compliance Expert, Project Manager, Master of Clinical and Forensic Psychology, and N00b Coder </h2>
    <p>
    Hello! I am Brittany, a certified Program Manager and subject matter expert in regulatory financial compliance. I have a Master of Science degree in clinical and forensic psychology and will be full stack software engineering certified in May 2024 via UCF.

    Throughout my 10+ year career, I have leveraged my formal education with technical knowledge to drive innovative solutions for Financial Institutions, Fintechs, MSBs, and Investment firms. I have lead teams to enhance and adopt change in operations and investigations, found gaps in automated detection models, and designed a behavioral risk score construct which projected positive impact to customer experience metrics via elimination of false positive escalations. 

    I get energized when collaborating cross functionally on projects and compliance initiatives where multiple domains come together to solve complex problems and share success and future roadmaps via presentations for high impact stakeholders.

    Personally, combining the above with personal grit and a growth mindset, I particularly enjoy translating evidence based findings into change management opportunities that provide regulatory and scope risk mitigation, customer protection and added value aligned with top OKRs.

    As a team player I am flexible yet organized, comfortable in taking ownership and being hands on in a fast paced environment that allows creativity to think outside the box. I lead with integrity and I'm willing to get in the weeds to learn or help, and always ask for feedback. I am invested in growth, respect, and will never stop learning.

    I am Brittany and I invite you to connect with me if you are looking to network with other industry professionals such as myself!
